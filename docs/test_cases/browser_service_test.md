# Browser Service Test Case

## Overview
This test validates the browser automation functionality using Playwright. It focuses on browser initialization, navigation, Frame.io interactions, and download management. These tests ensure reliable browser automation for downloading assets from Frame.io.

## Test File
`tests/services/test_browser_service.py`

## Test Execution
```bash
pytest tests/services/test_browser_service.py -v
```

## Test Components

### 1. Browser Initialization
- Tests browser service initialization and download directory creation
- Validates headless and non-headless browser launching
- Ensures proper browser context configuration
- Verifies download path setup

### 2. Page Navigation
- Tests navigation to URLs
- Validates page loading and readiness
- Ensures proper error handling for navigation failures

### 3. Frame.io Authentication
- Tests successful login to Frame.io with valid credentials
- Tests failed login with invalid credentials
- Validates login form interaction and submission

### 4. Download Management
- Tests waiting for downloads to complete
- Verifies download path and file creation
- Implements timeout handling for download operations

### 5. Resource Management
- Tests proper browser closure and resource cleanup
- Ensures all browser contexts and pages are properly closed

## Improvements Made

### DOM Element Handling
- Added retry logic for element selection to handle dynamic content
- Implemented better wait strategies for page elements
- Added error handling for detached DOM elements

### Download Reliability
- Added multiple download attempts with increasing delays
- Implemented verification of downloaded file integrity
- Added proper timeout handling for large file downloads

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensured download paths are platform-agnostic
- Fixed path handling for Windows vs. Linux environments
- Used absolute paths for download directories

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error messages for debugging
- Implemented proper exception handling for browser automation failures
- Added logging for browser automation steps

## Dependencies
- Playwright for browser automation
- pytest and pytest-asyncio for async test execution
- Python's unittest.mock for test mocking

## Configuration Requirements
- Frame.io credentials in environment variables
- Properly configured download directories

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper fixture usage for test setup and teardown
- Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- Async handling for browser operations
- Proper resource cleanup after test execution

# Asset Download Test Case

## Overview
This test validates the functionality of downloading media assets from Frame.io using browser automation. It tests end-to-end download flow, including browser initialization, navigation to Frame.io, and file retrieval.

## Test File
`tests/services/test_asset_download.py`

## Test Execution
```bash
python tests/services/test_asset_download.py
```

## Test Components

### 1. Browser Setup
- Initializes the BrowserService class
- Launches a browser instance (configurable as headless or visible)
- Sets up download directory for assets

### 2. Frame.io Navigation and Download
- Navigates to a specified Frame.io asset URL
- Handles authentication if required
- Finds and clicks the download button
- Selects appropriate resolution options
- Waits for download to complete

### 3. Download Verification
- Verifies file existence after download
- Checks file size and name
- Reports success or failure with detailed information

## Improvements Made

### Download Reliability
- Added proper wait strategies for download completion
- Implemented download verification to confirm file integrity
- Added timeout handling for large file downloads

### Error Handling
- Added proper exception handling for browser automation failures
- Improved logging for download steps and potential failures
- Added informative error messages for troubleshooting

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Fixed path handling for Windows vs. Linux compatibility
- Ensured download paths are created consistently
- Used absolute paths for download directories

## Dependencies
- Playwright for browser automation
- Python's asyncio for asynchronous execution
- OS and pathlib for file operations

## Configuration Requirements
- Frame.io asset URL must be provided
- Properly configured download directories in settings
- Optional headless mode configuration for CI/CD integration

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper async/await handling for browser operations
- Clean browser resource management with try/finally
- Clear reporting of test outcomes
- File size validation for download verification

# Headless Download Test Case

## Overview
This test validates the Frame.io asset download functionality specifically in headless browser mode. It ensures that the automation can run in CI/CD pipelines, servers, or other environments where a visible browser isn't needed or available.

## Test File
`tests/services/test_headless_download.py`

## Test Execution
```bash
python tests/services/test_headless_download.py
```

## Test Components

### 1. Headless Browser Setup
- Initializes the BrowserService class
- Launches a browser in fully headless mode (no visible UI)
- Configures appropriate browser settings for headless operation
- Sets up download directory for assets

### 2. Frame.io Navigation in Headless Mode
- Navigates to a specified Frame.io asset URL without visible browser
- Handles authentication if required
- Locates and interacts with download UI elements
- Manages download process without visible browser feedback

### 3. Download Management
- Monitors download progress without visual feedback
- Implements proper wait conditions for download completion
- Verifies file existence after download
- Reports file details (name, size) upon completion

## Improvements Made

### Headless Mode Reliability
- Enhanced element selectors for better reliability in headless mode
- Added specific wait strategies for headless operation
- Improved error handling for timing issues specific to headless execution
- Configured browser for optimal headless performance

### CI/CD Integration
- Made test suitable for running in automated pipelines
- Ensured test provides clear pass/fail outcomes
- Added detailed logging for debugging headless execution issues
- Made download paths configurable for different environments

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensured headless mode works across Windows, Linux, and containerized environments
- Fixed path handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Used absolute paths for download directories

## Dependencies
- Playwright for headless browser automation
- Python's asyncio for asynchronous execution
- OS and pathlib for file operations

## Configuration Requirements
- Frame.io asset URL must be provided
- Properly configured download directories
- No special browser or display server requirements (works on servers without GUI)

## Best Practices Implemented
- Proper async/await handling for browser operations
- Clean browser resource management with try/finally
- Clear reporting of test outcomes
- File verification after download
- Appropriate error handling for headless-specific issues

## Use Cases
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Server-side automation without display requirements
- Scheduled asset downloads in production environments
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent headless instances
